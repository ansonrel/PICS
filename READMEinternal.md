### TODOs

- Christian idea: set a protein-protein correlation matrix and create a score related to it (ideally, we want low prot-prot correlation,  indicating that they are well differenciated)

- Emannuel suggestion: t-test might again take the SD into account (double representing the SD of isotypes in the score). Suggested to use intead 'point comparison', basically like kolgrov-smirnoff test or similar.



- isotypes: try to scale everything to [0,1] so that it doesnt unfavor some methods such as scale

- try to regress out residuals that may come from batch effect, treatment, etc..?
